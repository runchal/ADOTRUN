That's not even the worst you can do with it. you can do money laundering, buy drugs online and sex toys, all anonymously. but that's not the point, because despite the coercion imposed by all kinds of regulatory systems so far, also current official monetary systems are full of that shit, on top of the capitalist pie.Emerging technologies should never be judged by the sensationally bad taste of early adopters. it's like being concerned about the shit that fertilizes some beautiful flowers, wasting their seeds.What really bitcoin is, I finally understood on the 6 april (which somehow always ends up being a magic day, eh!): this is now the end of the flow capitalism, which consists of the monopoly on transactions, the hegemony of banks on the movement of values and not just their storage, this middle-man mafia strangling the world as we speak.How right are now those South American countries asking the "taxation of transactions", an argument refrained in many speeches of the companeros. They studied the system and understood that there is a crucial problem there, that needs to be solved urgently. Yet i'd argue here taxation on transaction cannot be the solution. The solution is to eliminate the flow capitalists.If i want to give you money i'll give it to you. me and you, period. its fine that we'll pay our taxes for our communities, don't get me wrong this is not a tea bagger argument. its just not right that all what we do is in the hands of a third party, that has been caught cheating already many times: look at what happened at the paypal accounts of the Iraqi linux user group back in 2004, or even more recently to Wikileaks.We don't need those fat cheaters to be in between our value transactions anymore; the flow capital has played its disgusting role in the little laps of history for which it has been needed, now sadly these people won't give up what they have accumulated, so it makes more sense to leave them alone and multiply more monetary systems that work efficiently across diverse networks and that rely on the neutrality of a cryptographic authentication.the death of the flow capital is a new stage for the necrotization of capitalism.
